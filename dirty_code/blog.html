    I arrived to the Plano area yesterday, and was able to connect with the Choung family. They're<br>
    all so gracious, loving, and kind. I've never seen a family like this before! I'm so excited to <br>
    connect with Noah, Hannah, and Mr. and Mrs. Choung.
</p>
<h4>Side Note:</h4>
<p>
    Mr. Choung is absolutely amazing, and I am so glad that he's not only my career mentor, but<br> 
    also my spiritual one. I don't know how to thank him yet, but God will find a way. :)
