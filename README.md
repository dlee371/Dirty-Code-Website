# Dirty-Code-Website

Purpose of the project is a learning experience for myself to learn more and more web development. I am a beginner at web developement, 
and I plan to use this as self-educational entertainment.

The website contains very inefficient code, hence the name "Dirty Code." I was inspired by the Big O notation to write code as inefficently as possible.
