# Dirty-Code-Website

Purpose of the project is a learning experience for myself to learn more and more web development. I am a beginner at web developement, 
and I plan to use this as self-educational entertainment.

The website contains very inefficient code, hence the name "Dirty Code." I was inspired by the Big O notation to write code as inefficently as possible.

This is, simply put, my own personal website. It's not only for dirty code, but also for other things I feel like putting on the web. 

You can find the website at: http://dirtycode.net/
